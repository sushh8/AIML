The Project aims for detecting the different currency Notes of India and giving the correct output. 
The purpose of the project is that, As there are physically disable people in our country, this project would help to identify different currency notes. 
For Eg : For the blind person, When they are doing money transaction, as they are not able to see, this project would help them to do the transactions.
How this Project Useful - I have done research and found that, Person without seeing can hold the currency notes in 8 different forms.
The computer vision Algorithm i.e single shot mulitbox detector detects the currency notes in all 8 directions forms and hence making it Easier for the Blind person for doing the Transactions.
